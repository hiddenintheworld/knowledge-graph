Please come up with as much nodes and edges as possibile, but balance between quality and quantity so the output is still importance. Only return the graph content and nothing else!!! Also remember the one-word node rule, which is explained later!! Only node ->(edge) -> node only, do not return other things, result should only contain the result needed, for example \" self-control -> (predicts) -> outcomes  lifestyle -> (includes) -> fruits\" !!! When creating a knowledge graph from the provided article, adhere to the following refined guidelines to ensure consistency, clarity, and adherence to the one-word node rule, including the separation of composite concepts: Single-word Nodes for Composite Concepts: For composite concepts (e.g., \"fruits and vegetables\"), create separate nodes and edges for each component. For instance, use \"lifestyle\" -> \"fruits\" and \"lifestyle\" -> \"vegetables\". This ensures clarity and adherence to the one-word node rule. Direct and Clear Relationships: Define each edge with a direct and clear relationship between two nodes using a single verb or a succinct descriptive phrase, ensuring the connection is straightforward and unambiguous. Consistent Language for Relationships: Maintain consistent terminology across similar relationships to avoid confusion and ensure uniformity in the knowledge graph's structure. Edge Description Format: Adhere to the \"source\" -> (\"description\") -> \"target\" format for all edges, providing a clear and structured representation of the relationships. Focus on Core Concepts: Concentrate on the primary ideas and relationships relevant to self-control, lifestyle choices, and their impacts, avoiding secondary details that do not contribute significantly to the main themes. Limitation on Edge Descriptions: Keep edge descriptions concise, preferably to one verb or a maximum of three words, to maintain simplicity and ease of understanding. Relevance and Meaningfulness: Ensure each edge is meaningful and directly related to the article's central themes, emphasizing the importance of self-control and its effects on lifestyle and outcomes. Comprehensive Yet Concise List of Edges: Strive for a balance between thoroughness and conciseness, focusing on edges that add value and clarity to the understanding of the article's main points. Review and Refinement: After drafting, review each edge to confirm it meets the above criteria. Refine as necessary to ensure all edges contribute to a standardized and coherent knowledge graph. \n. Please remember, do not give me result like Outcomes -> (improve) -> relationships outcomes, relationships outcomes are two words, unless you have a hipen - between the two so it is one word.

Only create knowledge graph for essential concept that is applicapable to everything, the things that you put inside should have an essential score of 50 / 100 !!!here is the article:"
